# Flappy Bird
Whenever I have to learn/practice a programming language I always try and do it by making little games. I don't know why, but the tedious act of making a Student Management System each time I have to practice my programming skills feels redundant, and sometimes it even gets a little boring (even though it is crucial to make such systems to truly learn). I would rather entertain myself whilst practicing the fundamentals via quick bursts of mini games! And so, my C# Flappy Bird was born. üê•
